# LuvAudioDL

Youtube DL audio player written in Luvit 

I am not responsible for anything ever

# Usage

This can be ran via either an interactive prompt, aka: `luvaudiodl`

Or by using it like a standard CLI program, aka: `luvaudiodl help`

# Installation

## Linux:
1. Edit `start.sh` to `cd` to the directory you installed the program to, skip this step if you have the bot in your home directory`
2. Rename `start.sh` to something like `luvaudiodl` and then put it in your `$PATH`

## Windows:
I'm unsure of how to pass arguments to luvit via a `.bat` file like you can with a `.sh` file, so you'll probably need to either use this from the prompt and/or run it manually.

1. To use the prompt, just run `luvit src/main.lua`
